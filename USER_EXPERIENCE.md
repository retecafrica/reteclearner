### Step 4: Relevant Mathematics Topics
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  📚 What You Should Focus On in School          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                 │
│  1️⃣ MATHEMATICS                                 │
│     3 relevant topics                           │
│                                                 │
│  ──────────────────────────────────────────────│
│                                                 │
│  📐 Multiplication and Division       [10/10] ✨│
│                                                 │
│  Why it matters:                                │
│  Every construction calculation uses            │
│  multiplication and division - calculating      │
│  areas, volumes of concrete, numbers of         │
│  materials, and distributing resources.         │
│                                                 │
│  💡 REAL EXAMPLE:                               │
│  A bridge foundation needs concrete 15m long    │
│  × 8m wide × 2m deep. Volume = 15 × 8 × 2 =    │
│  240 cubic meters. If one truck carries 6       │
│  cubic meters, we need 240 ÷ 6 = 40 truckloads.│
│                                                 │
│  Used for: Material calculations, area/volume   │
│  computation, resource distribution, scheduling │
│                                                 │
│  ──────────────────────────────────────────────│
│                                                 │
│  🔢 Numbers and Numeration            [9/10] ⭐ │
│                                                 │
│  Why it matters:                                │
│  Civil engineers work with large quantities     │
│  daily - calculating cement bags needed         │
│  (50,000 blocks), project budgets               │
│  (GHS 2,500,000), land areas in square meters. │
│                                                 │
│  💡 REAL EXAMPLE:                               │
│  To build a school, a civil engineer           │
│  calculates: 'We need 125,000 blocks. Each     │
│  bag of cement joins 85 blocks. How many       │
│  cement bags do we need?' Answer: 125,000 ÷    │
│  85 = 1,471 bags.                               │
│                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Kwame thinks: "Oh! So THAT'S why my teacher keeps 
emphasizing multiplication! Engineers use it every 
single day for real construction work!"
```

### Step 5: Science Topics
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  2️⃣ INTEGRATED SCIENCE                          │
│     1 relevant topic                            │
│                                                 │
│  ──────────────────────────────────────────────│
│                                                 │
│  ⚙️ Simple Machines and Forces        [10/10] ✨│
│                                                 │
│  Why it matters:                                │
│  Understanding forces is fundamental to         │
│  structural engineering. Engineers calculate    │
│  loads, stresses, and use machines like         │
│  pulleys and levers on construction sites.      │
│                                                 │
│  💡 REAL EXAMPLE:                               │
│  To lift a 2000kg steel beam to the roof,      │
│  engineers use a pulley system with mechanical  │
│  advantage of 4, meaning workers only need to   │
│  apply 500kg of force.                          │
│                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Kwame thinks: "Science isn't just about memorizing! 
Engineers actually USE these force calculations to 
make construction safer and easier!"
```

### Step 6: BDT (Technical Drawing)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  3️⃣ BASIC DESIGN & TECHNOLOGY (BDT)             │
│     1 relevant topic                            │
│                                                 │
│  ──────────────────────────────────────────────│
│                                                 │
│  📏 Technical Drawing Basics          [10/10] ✨│
│                                                 │
│  Why it matters:                                │
│  All construction projects start with technical │
│  drawings. Civil engineers create blueprints    │
│  showing exact dimensions, scales, and          │
│  specifications for builders to follow.         │
│                                                 │
│  💡 REAL EXAMPLE:                               │
│  Drawing a road plan at 1:1000 scale means     │
│  1cm on paper = 10m in reality. A 50cm line    │
│  represents a 500m road.                        │
│                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Kwame thinks: "So THAT'S why we practice drawing 
to scale in BDT class! Real engineers need it to 
communicate their designs to construction teams!"

## Teacher Journey: "Miss Ama teaches Multiplication"

### Teacher's Challenge
```
📚 Teaching Topic: Multiplication & Division (Week 3)

❌ Old Approach:
"Today we'll learn multiplication. It's important 
for exams. Let's practice: 15 × 8 = ?"

Students think: "Why do we need this? When will 
I ever use multiplication in real life?"
```

### Teacher's Solution with RETEC
```
✅ New Approach with RETEC:

Miss Ama visits RETEC Career Explorer before class.

She clicks "Reverse Search" (future feature) or 
manually searches careers that use multiplication.

She finds:
- Civil Engineer [10/10 relevance]
- Entrepreneur [10/10 relevance]
- Quantity Surveyor [10/10 relevance]
- Electrician [9/10 relevance]
- Sales Representative [10/10 relevance]

She reads the REAL EXAMPLES from each career.
```

### In Class the Next Day
```
Miss Ama: "Class, before we start multiplication, 
let me show you something interesting..."

[Shows example from Civil Engineer]:
"A bridge foundation needs concrete 15m × 8m × 2m.
That's 240 cubic meters!"

[Shows example from Entrepreneur]:
"You buy 50 bottles at GHS 0.50 each. That's 
50 × 0.50 = GHS 25 total cost."

Students: "Oh! So multiplication isn't just for 
exams - professionals use it EVERY DAY!"

Engagement: 📈📈📈
Understanding: ✅ Improved
Motivation: 🚀 High
```

## Parent Journey: "Kofi's father sees poor grades"

### Before RETEC
```
Father: "Kofi, why are your Math grades so low?"

Kofi: "I don't understand why we need to learn 
this. Nobody uses Fractions in real life."

Father: "Just study hard. You need it for exams."

Kofi: 😒 (Unmotivated, confused about purpose)
```

### After RETEC
```
Father visits RETEC with Kofi.

Father: "Kofi, what do you want to be when you 
grow up?"

Kofi: "Maybe a Mobile Money Agent like Uncle Kwame."

[They search "Mobile Money Agent" together]

Results show:
✅ Basic Operations [10/10] - Daily cash transactions
✅ Money Calculations [9/10] - Fee calculations
✅ Record Keeping - Transaction logs

Father reads example:
"Starting float: GHS 5,000. Customer deposits 
GHS 200 (fee: GHS 5). New float = 5,000 + 200 = 
5,200. This is addition you do 50+ times a day!"

Kofi: "Wait... Uncle Kwame uses Math every single 
day? That's why he's always calculating in his head!"

Father: "See? Now you understand WHY you need Math."

Kofi: 💡 (Motivated, sees purpose, studies harder)
```
